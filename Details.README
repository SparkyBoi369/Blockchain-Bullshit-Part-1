Simple Crypto Trade Plat

This code uses the ccxt library to interact with the Binance and Bittrex 
exchanges. It initializes an object for each exchange, then uses 
the fetch_ticker() method to retrieve ticker information for 
the BTC/USDT trading pair. It compares the bid prices from each 
exchange and prints a message indicating which exchange has the 
higher bid price.
-
This code is just a simple example of how you can connect to 
different centralized exchanges and retrieve information. 
The actual implementation would be much more complex and would 
involve connecting to different protocols to connect decentralized
 exchanges, implementing security measures and also implementing 
 a way to link multiple blockchains into a single network.

 Basic ERC20 Token

This code defines a smart contract called "MyToken" that implements
 the basic functionality of a standard ERC20 token. It hasd the properties
 for the tokens name, symbol, and dumber of decimals, as well as total
 supply. The contract also includes a mapping for the balance of each address
 and a transfer function that allows for transferring tokens from one address
 to another.
-
Simple Zerocoin implementation

This code defines a smart contract called "MyZerocoinToken" that 
inherits from the "zerocoin" contract and implements the basic functionality
of the zerocoin protocol. It includes a mint function that allows users to
mint new zerocoins. The contract also includes a mapping for the balance
of each address and a "transfer" event
-
zk-SNARKs implementation

This code defines a smart contract called "MyZkSnarktoken" that 
implements the basic functionality of a token and uses zk-SNARKs to 
provide priovacy for the trnsactions. The 'verify' function in the 
verifier contract, which is inherited from the imported library, is
used to validate the transaction without revealing any information.

Note, this is a very basic example.
-
Basic Staking contract

This code defines a smart contract called 
"MyStaking" that allows token holders to stake 
and unstake tokens in exchange for rewards. The 
conract maintains a mapping of the stake of each address,
a mapping of the rewards earned, and the total supply of
the tokens. The 'stake' function allows a user to lock up
tokens in exchange for rewards and the 'unstake' function allows
the user to release their locked up tokens. The 'claim rewards'
function allows the user to claim the rewards earned for staking.
The 'calculaterewards' function is used to calculate the rewards
for the user, the logic for this function can be defined according
to the specific requirements of the project.

Regarding moving data around on a token, one way to do this is by
using the 'transfer' function. For example, in the staking contract,
the 'stake' function uses the 'transfer' function bto move around
the tokens from the users address to the contract's address and the
'unstake' function uses the 'transfer' function to move the tokens
back to the user's address.

Just a basic example.
-
Reference data token

This code defines a smart contract called "MyDataToken" that
stores a reference to a 10 GB of data in the form of an IPFS hash and
an address of the data owner. The 'setdata' function allows the 
data owner to set the IPFS hash of the data and the 'transferownership'
function allows the data owner to transfer the ownership of the token
and the data to another address.

As for sending the token through the blockchain, this can be done 
by calling the 'transfer' function that is specific to the token.

Again, a basic example.
-
Off Chain IPFS Data contract 

This smart contract, called "MyDataStorage" stores a reference
to the data in the form of an IPFS hash and an address of the 
data owner. The 'setdata' function allows the data owner to set 
the IPFS hash of the data, the 'transferownership' function allows
the data owner to transfer the ownership of the token and the data
to another address, and the 'retreivedata' function allows anyone to
retreive the data from IPFS using the IPFS hash stored in the 
smart contract.

Basic example
-
Data Sharding contract

This smart contract, called "MyDataSharding" implements data shardiong
by storing an array of data shards, which are structs that contain the 
hash of the data and the shard number. The 'setdata' function allows
the data owner to set the data shards by passing an array of hashes,
the 'transferownership' function allows the data owner to transfer
the ownership of the token and the data to another address, and the 
'retreivedata' function allows anyone to retreive a specific shard
of the data by providing the data owner's address and the shard number.

This is just another basic example.
-
Basic Security protocol

This code defines a smart contract called "MySecurityProtocol" that
implements a basic security protocol. The contract includes a mapping
of authorized addresses, an owner address, and an instance of ECDSA library.
The 'authorize' function allows the owner to authorize a specific user
to access the data, the 'revoke' function allows the owner to revoke
the authorization of a specific user, the 'encrypt' function allows an
authorized user to encrypt the data and the 'decrypt' function allows an
authorized user to decrypt the data.
-
Basic AES Encryption 

A basic AES Encryption
-
Basic Secure Encrypt Token

This code defines a smart contract called "MyToken" that
implements a basic token. The contract includes a mapping of
token balances, an owner address, a name, symbol, and decimals,
a mapping of authorized addresses, an address of data owner and 
a reference to the data in the form of an IPFS hash, and a key 
for encryption. The 'authorize' function allows the owner to 
authorize a specific user to access the token, the 'revoke' 
function allows the owner to revoke authorization, the 'mint' 
function allows the owner to set the datahash and the key for 
encryption, and the 'retreivedata' function allows anyone to 
retreive the data hash.

This is a basic example, and not ready for market deployment.
-
Basic Hot Wallet

This code defines a nsmart contract called "MyHotWallet" that implements 
a basic hot wallet. The contract includes a mapping of wallet balances,
an owner address. The 'deposit' function allows anyone to deposit funds
into the wallet, the 'withdraw' function allows the owner to withdraw
funds from the wallet, the 'checkbalance' function allows anyone to check
the balance of the wallet.

Basic example, not market ready.
-
Basic Secure Hot Wallet

Same as the Basic Hot wallet, but with added encryption.

Again, not market ready.
-
Secure Cold Wallet

A cold wallet with basic security and encryption.
-
Basic NFT

This code definers a smart contract called "MyNFT" that implements a
basic NFT. The contract includes a mapping of token ids to their owners,
a mapping of token ids to whether or not they exist, and an owner address.
The 'mint' function allows the owner to mint a new NFT, the 'transfer'
function allows the owner of the NFT to transfer it to another address,
and the 'burn' function allows the owner of an NFT to burn it.
-
Basic Audio NFT

This code defines a smart contract called "MyAudioNFT" that extends from the
"MyNFT" contract and implements an audio NFT. The conract includes a mapping
of token ids to their audio files. The 'mint' function is overriden to 
accept an additional parameter for the audio file, and a new function 
'retreiveaudio' which allows anyone to retreive the audio file of a 
specific token id.
-
Basic Media NFT

This code defines "MyMediaNFT" contract that has two functions 
'mintaudioNFT' and 'mintMP4NFT' which allow the owner to mint new NFTs for
audio and MP4 files respectively. Each NFT is identified by a unique tokenid
and stored in the mapping 'tokenidtoNFT'. The 'transfer' function allows the
owner of a 'tokenid' to transfer it to another address. The 'mint' function
and the 'transfer' function emit events that can be captured by external
contracts or users.
